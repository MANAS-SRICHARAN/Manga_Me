This Project involves creating animation from the realistic images and videos. I have tested this on bahubali movie(telugu) trained it for 3 days straight, and the results were better than i expected, i would recommend a gpu in case you are working on larger videos. I didn't code this from scratch , i have cloned this from another repo (FilipAndersson245) , please do look at his repo, there are some amazing porjects. Am planning to update this with gif animation. Thank you.
